# Adding a Client

The {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} Client is the piece of the puzzle that makes the magic happen.  The client establishes the initial connection between the on-premises network and a gateway on the {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} servers and allows for communication to pass through to the defined destinations.
