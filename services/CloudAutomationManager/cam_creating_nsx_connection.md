## What to do next

Deploy an NSXv template. The NSXv templates are saved to your local directory. See [Importing starter pack templates](cam_post_install.html#cam_starter_pack_configure) for details on how to import the templates to your local directory. For information about using the templates, see [Creating a template](cam_creating_template.html#creating-a-template) and [Deploying a template](cam_deploying_local.html#deploying-a-template).

For information about the available resources, see [NSXv Terraform Provider and Resource Documentation](https://github.com/IBM-tfproviders/terraform-provider-nsxv/wiki/NSXv-Terraform-Provider-and-Resource-Documentation){:new_window}.
