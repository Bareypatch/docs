# About Node-RED support
{: #config}

The {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics_full}} starter supports using Node-RED flows to send notifications, validate appliance registration, send commands to your appliances, and more. Sample Node-RED flows are provided to help you get started.
{: shortdesc}

Before you can work with the Node-RED flows, you must deploy an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics}} in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}  organization. Deploying an instance automatically deploys the component applications, services, and Node-RED sample registration flows. You must also [configure the {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} dashboard](iotelectronics_notifications.html#iot4e_enabledashboard) to enable registration.

For more information about Node-RED support, see the following information:
 - [Enabling notifications](iotelectronics_notifications.html)
 - [Configuring appliance registration](iotelectronics_config_app_reg.html)
