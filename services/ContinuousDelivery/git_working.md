# Git Repos and Issue Tracking
{: #git_working}

Collaborate with your team and manage your source code with a Git repository (repo) and issue tracker that is hosted by IBM and built on [GitLab Community Edition ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://about.gitlab.com/){:new_window}.
{: shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.gitrepos}} tool integration supports teams to manage code and collaborate in many ways:
   * Manage Git repositories through fine-grained access controls that keep code secure
   * Review code and enhance collaboration through merge requests
   * Track issues and share ideas through the issue tracker
   * Document projects on the wiki system

**Note:** Because this tool integration is built on GitLab Community Edition and hosted by IBM on Bluemix, a few GitLab options are not available. For example, Delivery Pipeline provides continuous integration and continuous delivery for Bluemix; therefore, the continuous integration features in GitLab are not supported. In addition, the admin functions are not available because they are managed by IBM.

## File and repo size limits
{: #git_limits}

Files are strictly limited to 100 MB. The suggested repo size limit is 1 GB. If your repo exceeds 1 GB, you might receive an email with a request to reduce the size of the repo.

## Using Git Repos and Issue Tracking locally
{: #git_authentication}

You can locally access the Git repos that are stored in {{site.data.keyword.gitrepos}}. For instructions to set up Git locally, see [Start using Git on the command line ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://git.ng.bluemix.net/help/gitlab-basics/start-using-git){:new_window}.

### Creating a personal access token or SSH key for authentication  
To complete remote Git operations, such as `clone` or `push`, from your local Git repo, you must use a personal access token or SSH key to authenticate with GitLab.

* To set up a personal access token, see [Personal access tokens ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://git.ng.bluemix.net/help/api/README.html#personal-access-tokens){:new_window}.
* To set up an SSH key, see [SSH ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://git.ng.bluemix.net/help/ssh/README){:new_window} or [How to create your SSH Keys ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://git.ng.bluemix.net/help/gitlab-basics/create-your-ssh-keys){:new_window}. Accessing your repositories with SSH authentication might require more configuration for proxies and firewalls.
