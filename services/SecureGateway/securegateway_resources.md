## Using the IBM {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} SDK for Bluemix
If you want to manage your {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} from a node.js app, you can use the JavaScript SDK. So if you work in JavaScript and want to interact with the {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} REST interface, there is no need for you to make the REST calls. The JavaScript SDK sets up the HTTP calls and puts them into easy to use functions.  It is available as an NPM project here:
